This is a basic JUnit parser for the Go programming language.

As there is no definitive JUnit XSD that I could find, the XML documents read
by this package should correspond to a [JUnit XSD
scheme](https://svn.jenkins-ci.org/trunk/hudson/dtkit/dtkit-format/dtkit-junit-model/src/main/resources/com/thalesgroup/dtkit/junit/model/xsd/).
