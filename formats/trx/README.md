This is a basic TRX parser for the Go programming language.

TRX files are test result files that are created either by Microsoft Visual
Studio or Microsoft MSTest. Visual Studio is a program used to develop Windows
software, while MSTest is a command-line utility to run various unit tests for
Visual Studio. The test results from these unit tests are saved in a TRX file
and in the XML format. Thus, the TRX files help to visualize the test results
and display them in Visual Studio. TRX files can also be used to save test
results from older tests.
